# Friday: Accessibility-focused Application Empowering Inclusive Interactions
Friday is a revolutionary full-stack Angular web application designed to empower users with disabilities through inclusive AI-driven voice interactions. Inspired by Tony Stark's AI assistant in the MCU, this cutting-edge platform integrates Google Cloud Services and ChatGPT's API to offer seamless, voice-controlled speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities, hosted via the Google Cloud SDK.

# Key Features

# 1. Voice-Controlled Accessibility
Friday's core innovation lies in its voice-controlled accessibility, enabling individuals with physical impairments to effortlessly interact with the application. Through the integration of Google Cloud Services and ChatGPT's API, users can navigate and communicate within the application using natural language and voice commands.

# 2. Robust Server-Side Architecture
At the heart of Friday is a robust server-side architecture, powered by Node.js and Express.js. Our meticulously engineered server-side APIs optimize data flow, response times, and overall backend efficiency. This ensures that users experience a seamless and responsive interaction with the application, irrespective of their abilities.

# 3. Inclusivity as the Driving Force
Friday is not just another web application; it's a commitment to inclusivity. Our mission is to break down technological barriers for physically impaired individuals, expanding user engagement and promoting accessibility. By championing accessibility, Friday empowers a broader audience to harness the power of AI-driven voice interactions.

# How It Works
Voice Commands: Users can activate Friday's voice interaction feature by simply speaking a trigger word or phrase, this works in both English and Mandarin, initiating the application's listening mode.

Natural Language Processing: Friday leverages ChatGPT's powerful natural language processing capabilities to understand and interpret voice commands and queries.

Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech: With the integration of Google Cloud Services, Friday converts voice inputs into text and provides text-based responses as speech, making it a two-way communication channel.

Customization: Users will be able to customize their own virtual assistant in both Chinese and English. Down to the virtual assistant's pitch, speed and type of voice. Users also have the opportunity to input personal details about themselves, allowing for more tailored responses and increasing customization capacity for the virtual assistant.

Intuitive Navigation: Users can use voice commands to navigate through the application, browse content, submit queries, and interact with various features seamlessly.

Enhanced Accessibility: Friday's architecture ensures that individuals with disabilities can enjoy an accessible and inclusive online experience. The platform's voice-driven approach eliminates the need for manual inputs, making it particularly suitable for those with limited mobility.

Efficient Backend: Behind the scenes, the Node.js and Express.js backend processes and routes voice inputs and queries efficiently, delivering rapid responses to enhance the user experience.
